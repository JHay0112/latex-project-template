# Project Report Template

This is a LaTeX template based upon the report requirements laid out for engineering design reports in ENEL200 (a University of Canterbury design course). It has been tested in VS Code with LaTeX Workshop and TeX Live on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS.

## GitHub work flow

This template comes with a GitHub work flow for automatically compiling the document on GitHub. Once the compilation is complete the final report can be found attached to the release on GitHub.
