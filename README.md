# Project Report Template

This is a LaTeX template based upon the requirements laid out for engineering design reports in 
ENEL200 and ENEL300 (a University of Canterbury design course). This repository also contains a
Makefile for automating the compilation of the report. Due to my own use-case this includes recipes
for the inclusion of schematics from KiCad.

## GitHub work flow

This template comes with a GitHub work flow for automatically compiling the document on GitHub. Once
the compilation is complete the final report can be found attached to the release on GitHub.
