# Project Report Template

This is a LaTeX template aimed at providing a consistent and pleasant report style suitable for 
engineering documents. The original inspiration for the layout of these reports comes from my 
education at the University of Cantebury. 

This repository contains Makefiles based around latexmk for performing the compilation of the LaTeX
document. The Makefiles include functionality for including standalone tikz diagrams, and including
schematics from KiCAD (a rather niche use-case close to my heart).

Feel free to use this template as you wish.
